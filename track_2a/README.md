# Academia Challenges

Submissions must use the Apertus model family.
For Track 2 this to means that submitted solutions must be built with Apertus. Other open-weights models can be used to support development, e.g as automatic judges during evaluation. Their role must be clearly described in the submission report.

## Run it

Move the contents of `track_2a/` to the root of your repo and delete all the
`track_*` directories. Your repo root is your project root: judges run
`make run` from there.

From the root of the project:

```bash
make run
```

Fill in the [Makefile](Makefile) so that works on a clean checkout.

Requirements: `runtime, hardware, API keys, model weights`

## Data

Store your data in `data/` and commit it with your project. If it is too big
for git (GitHub rejects files over 100 MB), upload it to
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) instead and link it from
`technical_report.md`, together with where the data came from.
